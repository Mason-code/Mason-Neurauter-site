For my Specialized Writing Assignment, I will focus on Alex Honold. Hailing from California, Honnold gained fame for climbing the 2,900 route on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park with no safety equipment. The route was called Freerider at a grade of 5.13a, which is the most difficult climb ever recorded while free soloing. He was born on August 17, 1985 and is surprisingly still alive to this day.


I first learned about Honnold’s feats from a documentary a few years ago, Free Solo. Being able to be that strong of a climber is extremely impressive. 1 thing goes wrong and it's the end. His ability to focus apparently part of his brain just stopped acknowledging fear. This is something people probably shouldn’t be inspired by. Unless you are a strong climber and the conditions are good, climbing without gear is idiotic. Like Usan Bolt from my previous Specialized Writing Assignment, Honnold is one of the best athletes in his field.

One thing I find cool about Alex Honnold is his ability to drown his whole life in rock climbing. He has no concern for anything except rock climbing. He used to live a very scrappy lifestyle with lots of camping and climbing. Now, I think he has a family to focus on but nothing wrong with that. Another fun fact is that he used to live out of a van so he can stay close to climbing spots, which shows his dedication to climbing. Like Alex I also rock climb, I have been for the past 2 years but haven’t been going frequently until recently. Also I haven’t climbed outdoors yet. It's a bigger commitment and climbing in the gym is fun.
