For my Specialized Writing Assignment, I will focus on George Washington. Born in Virginia on February 22, 1732, Washington is famous for being the first President of the United States and leading the American army during the Revolutionary War. He played a big part in winning the war against the British, helping America become an independent country. After the war, he became the first president, and his decision to only serve two terms set a standard that future presidents would follow.

I first learned about George Washington back in school, and I’ve always thought his role in the Revolution was really cool. The story of him crossing the Delaware River for a surprise attack really stands out. What’s even more impressive is that when he could’ve stayed in power longer, he decided to step down, which shows he really cared about the future of the country and not just his own position. While I don’t think about Washington all the time, his decisions still shaped the way America is today.

One thing I find cool about George Washington is how he didn’t just lead soldiers in battle, but also helped shape the government afterward. He wasn’t just about fighting; he had ideas for the country, too. Washington could’ve just stayed on his farm at Mount Vernon and lived a quiet life, but he chose to serve his country even when it wasn’t easy. Even though he was wealthy, he understood the importance of hard work and making sacrifices, which is something I think is really admirable.
