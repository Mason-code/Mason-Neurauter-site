# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my US History website!**

I'm Mason Neurauter, a junior in Mr. Nichols' US History class. This site will feature all of my topic organizer assignments and serve as a place to track my progress in class.

<hr />

Feel free to look around and check out the assignments I've completed so far. And I'm aware this website isn't perfect.
