At that time, such buildings were constructed near ports to accommodate the growing number of people working on the busy docks where goods were traded. The unique design of row houses made them easier and less expensive to build than separate houses. An urban renewal program in the 1950s led to the restoration of many of these buildings in Philadelphia.

Slavery became entrenched due to the demand for agricultural labor. While slavery was widespread, concurrent development of ideas about freedom and democracy eventually led to conflicts over equality.

Southern planters used chattel slavery as it was a permanent and inexpensive labor source for their extensive farms.

### 3. Analyze Cause and Effect
**What factors might limit our understanding of the impact slavery had on enslaved people in the South?**
