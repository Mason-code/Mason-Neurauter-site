For my Specialized Writing Assignment, I will focus on Usain Bolt. Hailing from Jamaica, Bolt gained international acclaim for setting the world record in the 100 meters on August 16, 2009, at the World Championships in Berlin. At just 23 years old, he completed the distance in a staggering 9.58 seconds, earning him the nickname “Lightning Bolt” and solidifying his status as a global icon in athletics.

I wasn’t at the World Championships in 2009, I doubt I was watching it on tv. Mainly because I was 1 year old at the time but it's fascinating to me that despite having no memory of the event his fame seems like common knowledge to a person like me. Creating a world record, especially one in a major sporting event like the 100m sprint, by definition makes you the best in the world at that thing and gives you immense fame. Usian Bolt had pushed his body further than anyone had before and now my brain is trained to think of Usian Bolt when there is anything to do with running. Usian Bolt has easily inspired many people, even me to a certain extent. When you’re hanging out with your friends you can try and beat the 9.58 seconds. You won’t beat the monstrous record but it's fun to see the difference between you and the greatest runner ever.

Some things I find cool about Usian Bolt are that he even made world records in events other than the 100m sprint. The other events were still running related but it shows he is good at many different things. The world records are amazing but he also has multiple Olympic gold medals which in itself is quite the feat. One fact about Usian Bolt is that he is 6 foot 5 inches which makes sense. Longer legs would translate into more distance covered. Funnily enough, he wasn’t drawn to running at first. He tried to play Cricket but at some point he moved onto running which was better suited for him.
