For my Specialized Writing Assignment, I will focus on Usain Bolt. Hailing from Jamaica, Bolt gained international acclaim for setting the world record in the 100 meters on August 16, 2009, at the World Championships in Berlin. At just 23 years old, he completed the distance in a staggering 9.58 seconds, earning him the nickname “Lightning Bolt” and solidifying his status as a global icon in athletics.
